## Summary 
The following project utilizes R to mine sentiment from over 21,000 hotel reviews on resorts located in the Republic of Maldives, a South Asian country located in the Indian Ocean. 

## File Directory

1. [**data**](https://github.com/ianjeffries/election-predictions/tree/master/data) - contains three data sets used in analysis (taken from kaggle, referenced in the credits):  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. [county_facts.csv](https://github.com/ianjeffries/election-predictions/blob/master/data/county_facts.csv) - Demographic breakdown of each county.  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. [county_facts_dictionary.csv](https://github.com/ianjeffries/election-predictions/blob/master/data/county_facts_dictionary.csv) - Dictionary to decode variable names in county_facts.csv.  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. [pres16results.csv](https://github.com/ianjeffries/election-predictions/blob/master/data/pres16results.csv) - Results of the 2016 election by county.
     
2. [**images**](https://github.com/ianjeffries/election-predictions/tree/master/images) - contains vizualizations:  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. [decision_tree.png](https://github.com/ianjeffries/election-predictions/blob/master/images/decision_tree.png) - Decision tree created from modelling process.  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. <font color="black">[model_comparison.png](https://github.com/ianjeffries/election-predictions/blob/master/images/model_comparison.png)</font> - Comparison of 3 classification models used.  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. [population_trends.png](https://github.com/ianjeffries/election-predictions/blob/master/images/population_trends.png) - Population size by voting preference.  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d. [voting_trends.png](https://github.com/ianjeffries/election-predictions/blob/master/images/voting_trends.png) - Voting trends by top 5 normalized demographics.  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e. [democrat_arules.png](https://github.com/ianjeffries/election-predictions/blob/master/images/democrat_arules.png) - Scatterplot of democratic association rules by support and confidence.  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f. [republican_arules.png](https://github.com/ianjeffries/election-predictions/blob/master/images/republican_arules.png) - Scatterplot of republican association rules by support and confidence.  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g. [democrats_grid.png](https://github.com/ianjeffries/election-predictions/blob/master/images/democrat_grid.png) - Color grid of democratic association rules.  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;h. [republican_grid.png](https://github.com/ianjeffries/election-predictions/blob/master/images/republican_grid.png) - Color grid of republican association rules. 
  
3. [**classification**](https://github.com/ianjeffries/election-predictions/tree/master/classification) - contains classification files that predict election outcome based off demographics:  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. [classification.Rmd](https://github.com/ianjeffries/election-predictions/blob/master/classification/classification.Rmd) - R Markdown detailing the classification process, from data cleaning to model creation.  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. [classification.pdf](https://github.com/ianjeffries/election-predictions/blob/master/classification/classification.pdf) - PDF that shows R code and the outputted results, for easy viewing.
  
4. [**association_rules**](https://github.com/ianjeffries/election-predictions/tree/master/association_rules) - contains association rules files:  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. [association_rules.Rmd](https://github.com/ianjeffries/election-predictions/blob/master/association_rules/association_rules.Rmd) - R Markdown to mine rules that relate to demographics and voting preference.  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. [association_rules.pdf](https://github.com/ianjeffries/election-predictions/blob/master/association_rules/association_rules.pdf) - PDF that shows R code and the outputted results, for easy viewing.
  
5. [**results.pdf**](https://github.com/ianjeffries/election-predictions/blob/master/results.pdf) - A full write-up comparing classification and association rules mining in R vs SAS.

## Language and Packages Used

R is used for all model building - the results are compared in R vs SAS.

The following packages are used:
  
  ```
#list of packages used
packages <- c("dplyr", "tidyr", "ggplot2", "class", "rpart", "rpart.plot", "neuralnet", "arules",
              "plyr", "mltools", "arulesViz", "plotly", "RCurl")

#check to see if package is already installed, if not, install
for(p in packages){
  if(!require(p, character.only = TRUE)) {
    install.packages(p)
    library(p, character.only = TRUE)
  } 
}
```
